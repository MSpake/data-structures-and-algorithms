# Challenge Summary  
Find the depth of a given value.  
  
## Challenge Description  
Given a binary tree and a value, find the depth of that value if it is present (otherwise return null). Implement recursively.    
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
Space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.  
Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
