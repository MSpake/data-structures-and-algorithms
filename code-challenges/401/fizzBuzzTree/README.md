# Challenge Summary  
FizzBuzz, but with a binary tree.  
  
## Challenge Description  
Write a function that takes in a binary tree, traverse through the tree, for each node: if the value is divisable by 3, replace it with 'fizz', if it is divisable by 5, replace it with 'buzz', if it is divisable by both 3 and 5, replace it with 'fizzbuzz'.  
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
Space complexity is O(1), node values are changed in place.  
Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
