# Reverse an Array   
Reverses the order of elements in an array.  
  
## Challenge  
To take in an array of any length and return an array with the elements in reverse order without using build in methods.
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
I opted for a for loop that started at the input array .length - 1 and decremented to 0, pushing the elements into a new array one at a time from end to beginning.
