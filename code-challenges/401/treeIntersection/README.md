# Challenge Summary  
Given two binary trees, find the shared values.   
  
## Challenge Description  
Given two binary trees, return a set containing all the values that are present in both trees.    
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the input.  
Space: Either O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the first tree, or O(h) where h is the height of the second tree, whichever is larger.
