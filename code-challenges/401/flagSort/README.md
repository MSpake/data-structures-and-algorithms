# Challenge Summary  
Sort strings into a flag distribution.    
  
## Challenge Description  
Given an array of strings that are either "blue", "white", or "shield", sort them into a 'flag' with the pattern blue, white, shield, white, blue. There are an even number of blues, an even number of whites, and only one shield.   
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
Space complexity is O(1), elements are swapped in place.    
Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
