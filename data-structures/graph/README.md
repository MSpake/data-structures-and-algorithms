# Graphs  
  
## Challenge  
Given starter code, replace the array in graph.js with a linked list, replace the array in bfs.js with a queue, and replace the array in dfs.js with a stack.  
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
Using more optimal data structures reduced the time complexity of the breadth first traversal, but I'm not sure it made much difference for the others.  
    
## API  
Breadth-first Path finder  
Depth-first Path Finder  
Dijkstra Path Finder
